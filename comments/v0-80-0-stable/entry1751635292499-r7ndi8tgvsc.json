  "comment": "Love the payees system, and the mass editing made adding payees to all my transactions super simple. \n\nWould love a preference/option to have the app always switch to the current month when opening, because I ALWAYS forget to switch when the new month starts and then end up having to edit a dozen transactions to the correct date when I finally notice. \n\nThat would be a nice quality of life feature.",
