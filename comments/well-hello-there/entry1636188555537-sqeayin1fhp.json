  "comment": "Hope all is well on your end, Matt. Just wanted to chime in and say that as a Ynab refugee, I'm super encouraged to see your level of commitment. Been spending the past couple of hours trying out the desktop app and am super pleased with what I'm seeing. \n\nI don't mind not having cloud syncing as local storage/syncing using Google Drive does the job for me. And bank importing tbh isn't a top priority as I use my credit cards for most things and prefer not having my bank activities be so openly visible. \n\nBut ONE feature I'd love to have is just easier movement of budgeting/allocations from one bucket to another.  Ynab mobile and desktop let us tap on the remaining balance left in a category, enter a dollar amount that want to move to another category, then press enter to initiate the move. \n\nEverything else is looking great so far. Down to wait as long as needed for the Android app as I totally get why companies develop for iOS first.\n",
