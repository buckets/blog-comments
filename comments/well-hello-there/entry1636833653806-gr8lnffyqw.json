  "comment": "Another YNAB refugee here. I think Buckets may be a really good option. A couple of things though .. Why is there no payee field? When I import transactions, it only has the memo field - which shows debit or credit. While helpful to have the transactions there, it would be much more helpful to have the payee names import as well. Speaking of importing transactions - There are three different accounts I like to import - checking and two credit cards. I imported checking transactions this morning with no issue, but then tried importing a credit cards transactions - they won't import. Am I correct in thinking you can only import transactions from one account/institution?",
