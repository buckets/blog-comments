  "comment": "Hello! This is really exciting. I have the app you linked to on reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetwithbuckets/comments/xjs4mi/any_daring_android_users/) a few months ago. For some reason, this trial app claims it is not compatible with my phone (Samsung Galaxy S9). Have there been any sort of compatibility changes in your app? Or do you anticipate the supported device list to be expanded as the beta progresses?\n\nThanks!",
