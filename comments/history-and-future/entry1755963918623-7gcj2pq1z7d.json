  "comment": "Hi Matt! I have been using buckets for 3 years now, coming out of college and moving to my new home. I am in the worst financial situation I've seen in a while now because of being out of a job, but it is looking up since I've gotten back with using buckets. I've appreciated the updates, and I really should try to get those macros working for my new bank. This really is a helpful and wonderful app. ",
