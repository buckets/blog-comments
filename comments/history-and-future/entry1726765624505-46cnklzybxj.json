  "comment": "Matt,\n\nI've worked with many budgeting apps and Buckets is the most to my liking so far, that is a huge compliment. ;-) I really like the down-to-earth, no-nonsense approach you've been taking with Buckets.\n\nOf course, I still would've done some things differently but because I have worked with so many apps already, I know that in the end it really doesn't matter that much.\n\nKeep it up and lots of love from Germany,\nBassim",
