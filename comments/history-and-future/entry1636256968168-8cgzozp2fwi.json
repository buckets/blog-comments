  "comment": "Beamer has point.  Not sure how many you'll get but seems possible to look for YNAB off-ramp here as well.  I don't know if you look for inspiration elsewhere but they have a good system.  I saw the YNAB4 import.\n\nTrack income - put that in categories(buckets)\nAs expenses occur for particular Category/Credit Card, move the money from the transaction's Category-Available to the Credit Card-Payment.\nReconcile Accounts to make sure all of your available funds are accounted for(every dollar a job.)\n\nWishing you well either way.",
