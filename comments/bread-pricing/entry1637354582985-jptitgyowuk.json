  "comment": "Nice - I already jumped over from YNAB when they first went SaaS, and although I've missed a few conveniences that come with size, I've overall enjoyed the workflow of buckets better after a while - Rain particularly was already very close to how my workflow was in YNAB, with notes so that I remembered how much to allocate for each category, so just being able to push a single button to do it all is great.",
