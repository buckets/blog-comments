  "comment": "This is really clever. It reminds me of The Big Mac Index (https://www.economist.com/big-mac-index) that is used to estimate real inflation across the world, but it's more accessible as MacDonald's probably isn't in every country. Every country probably has bread though.\n\nI love that you not only considered this but implemented it and made it real.",
