  "comment": "Don't let the mobile app keep you from supporting buckets!! Honestly, I hardly ever used the mobile app from YNAB when I thought I would especially since I've gone to mainly CC spending and importing transactions.  Sometimes less is more as I'm learning since moving on from YNAB 4 I'm learning to use the tools to make my budgeting more efficient. Also, I love the categorizing of CC transactions, way better than YNAB!",
