  "comment": "This finally allows me to import OFX from my second bank - however, the beta is allowing duplicate imports on this account instead of updating existing transactions, and it's also reporting that the synced balance doesn't match - as far as I can tell the OFX file contains no value for synced balance (<LEDGERBAL>), so it's being read as 0?\n\nI don't think this is quite coherent enough to log as an issue, so I'm putting it here.",
