  "comment": "Matt, I applaud what you are doing.  However, watching the progress is like watching grass grow.  in January.  under 3 ft of snow.  Iâ€™m a YNAB user and have a paid license for Buckets.  At your current rate if progress, it will take you 2 to 3 more years to get where YNAB was 5 years ago.  The features that are being requested here are very basic requirements that almost every other software package already has.  I realize that this is not where you make your living to feed your family, but you are at great risk of being a day late (or years late) and a dollar short for making any real difference in the personal finance software world.  I wish you all the best and hope you can pull things off quickly.",
