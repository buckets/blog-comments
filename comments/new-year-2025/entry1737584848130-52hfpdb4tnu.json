This is by far the most intuitive budgeting system and app I have found, it's wonderful! and 2.) to back up the first statement, I have only been using the software for a few hours and I've already imported all my transactions for this month and last month, assigned them to buckets, and set budgeting goals. I feel like I actually have a plan for my money, including the cash in my wallet. As soon as I reach the budget target, I will certainly be buying a full license. Thank you so much!",
